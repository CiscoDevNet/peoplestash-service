# peoplestash-service

This project is a service that allows you to pull data about cards, users, boards etc. from LeanKit using the Lean Kit APIs.
Then, we use ELK stack to do visualization and analysis of our people logs.

In this project you will find:

- service
	app.py - a python web app using flask that exposes a web api that returns lean kit data that is organized into a format that works well with ELK stack.

- server.config - example config file for logstash

#TODO - add more info about how to install
#TODO - add plugins for APIs for other work tracking tools
